# Rock, paper, scissors game. 
This project is a basic game of the game rockpaperscissors(rps), from The Odin Project.
With this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using JS for functions, loops and conditionals statements and th DOM.
You can play the game simply interacting with your mouse on the screen.
Hope you like it and may you win!
